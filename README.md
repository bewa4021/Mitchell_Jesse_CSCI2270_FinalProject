# Mitchell_Jesse_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Our project is a simple address book and calender using a binary tree and a linked list respectively.
The BST  and LL would be organized by name and time. Some functionalities include adding, editing, 
and removing contacts and appointments, sending emails (well, fake emails) and searching/traversing the 
data strcutures. We'll only be using standard libraries and it will probably only be usable on mac and 
linux (for sure the VM provided by the course) but it's worth a try on windows as well. 
Included in the repository under the "TestMe" directory is an executable file by the same name which 
should run the program. If it does not run, compile the source code and headers found in the the "TestMe" folder.
folder of the repository. Further instructions will be given by the program itself. 
Our only contributors and group members were Taylor Jesse and Nelson Mitchell. 
We have no known bugs to speak of but are happy to fix any we get feedback about.
